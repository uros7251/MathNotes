# Math Notes
## What's in there?
This repo contains notes I gathered in the last few years in the area of applied math. 

## How they came about?
They have been originally written for the purpose of assembling many results I had recreated myself into a single document where I can look them up when needed. For that reason, I wrote them in Serbian, and only recently did I translate them to English. I have used Google Translate to do this, since I didn't have much time or motivation to do it myself, so I apologize in advance if there are any grammatical errors or some sentences sound a bit odd.

## Why have I put them online anyway?
I decided to upload them online for two reasons. First, someone else might also find them useful (however improbable that might be). Second, it may serve to better illustrate my interests and previous work in math and physics to those rare viewers of my profile.

## Incomplete
I will eventually write about other topics including regression analysis, analytical mechanics (Lagrange and Hamilton's formalism), statistical mechanics, entropy, vector differential operators, fluid mechanics, special theory of relativity, etc.
